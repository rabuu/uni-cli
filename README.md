# uni-cli
My in-house university workflow tool.

See `uni --help` for all CLI options.

## Uni directory
The uni directory is the main directory where this tool operates.
Per default it is expected to be at `~/uni/`.

You can set another uni directory with the `--directory`/`-d` flag.

## Configuration
The mandatory configuration file is `UNI-DIRECTORY/uni-cli.toml`.
It is generally managed by the CLI tool itself but can be edited manually.
